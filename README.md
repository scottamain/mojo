# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research 
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems 
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed
to become a superset of Python over time.  

We plan to open-source Mojo progressively over time, but it's changing very quickly now. 
We believe that a small, tight-knit group of engineers with a shared vision can move 
faster than a community effort, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until 
it's more complete. We've opened this repo now because we want to gather issues and get
feedback from Mojo users. For more information about this and other common questions,
see the [Mojo FAQ](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/faq.html).

[See here to get started with Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/).
Then, when you want to report issues or request features,
[please create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).
